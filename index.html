        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Economic Geography at the London School of Economics, 
            funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. My supervisors are 
            <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment/people/academic-staff/riccardo-crescenzi" target="_blank">Riccardo Crescenzi</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute/people/monastiriotis-vassilis" target="_blank">Vassilis Monastiriotis</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research examines how regions can harness Foreign Direct Investment 
            and integration into Global Value Chains to stimulate local economic development, build resilience to
            shocks and uncertainty, and support the transition to a greener economy. I am particularly 
            interested in the role of regional institutions - especially Investment Promotion Agencies - in 
            shaping whether foreign investments prove transformational for local economies.
        </p>
        <p>
            My background is in Economics & Geography, having completed a BSc in Economics & Geography from
            University College London, plus an MSc in Local Economic Development from the London School of
            Economics.
            
            Before starting my PhD, I worked as a policy analyst at Policy in Practice and as a consultant 
            for the World Bank. Alongisde my PhD, I have worked as a Research Officer on the EU Horizon-funded ESSPIN project, 
            leading a Europe-wide survey of Investment Promotion Agencies. I am
            currently also the Co-PI on an International Growth Centre (IGC) funded research project to measure 
            and understand patterns of green FDI/GVCs into Africa.

            <div class="paper-abstract">
                This paper investigates whether Investment Promotion Agencies' sector-targeting strategies 
                protected inward FDI during the Brexit uncertainty period (2016–2019). Using a 
                difference-in-differences design, I find that pre-2015 IPA targeting increased repeat 
                knowledge-intensive services FDI, with effects concentrated in regions outside South East 
                England and among investments motivated by regional ecosystem factors. These findings suggest 
                that institutional effectiveness during uncertainty operates through ecosystem-building rather 
                than information provision.

                This paper examines whether Investment Promotion Agencies can attract green foreign direct investment through targeted sector strategies. 
                Combining novel data on IPA targeting with a new classification of green FDI that extends beyond renewables, 
                we investigate whether pre-existing IPA strategies to promote green sectors shaped the geography of green investment flows into European regions. 
                The findings speak to whether place-based industrial policy can support the green transition by steering foreign investment toward low-carbon activities.

            <div class="paper-status">With Riccardo Crescenzi, Marco Di Cataldo & Mara Giua — In preparation</div>
            <div class="paper-abstract">
                While most research on Investment Promotion Agencies focuses on their role in attracting new foreign investors, 
                this paper examines whether IPAs also influence the behaviour of established multinational enterprises. 
                Using project-level data on FDI expansions and divestments across European regions, we investigate whether IPA activities affect the retention and growth of existing foreign investments 
                — a channel that remains largely unexplored despite the increasing importance of repeat investment in global FDI flows.

            <div class="paper-status">In preparation</div>
            <div class="paper-abstract">
                This paper uses qualitative evidence from in-depth interviews with Investment Promotion Agency professionals across European regions to understand how these institutions operate in practice. 
                Moving beyond the standard framing of IPAs as information providers, I am exploring how agencies coordinate with universities, local governments, and incumbent firms to 
                build the regional ecosystems that attract and embed foreign investors. The findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in institutional capabilities and strategies, 
                with implications for understanding when and how place-based investment promotion proves effective.
